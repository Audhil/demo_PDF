demo_PDF
========
I found PDFJet a perfect library to convert anything PDF, using that I created a PDF of an image by placing inside assets/ of my project. You can browse for source code and use it in your projects if needed. You may get the  final PDF  file inside /storage/sdcard0/Pictures/dummy of device.
